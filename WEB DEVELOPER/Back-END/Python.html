    <h2>Python</h2>
    <p>
      Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features
      such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference
      counting, and Unicode support.[49] Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially
      set for 2015, and then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body
      of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[50][51]
      It no longer receives security patches or updates.[52][53] While Python
      2.7 and older versions are officially unsupported, a different unofficial
      Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e.,
      "2.7.18+" (plus 3.10), with the plus signifying (at least some)
      "backported security updates"
